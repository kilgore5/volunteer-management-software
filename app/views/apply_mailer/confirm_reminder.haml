          %p We need to confirm all positions by midday 11 October, so if you have not accepted your position by then, and have not contacted us with any issues, we will offer your spot to the next person on the waiting list.
          %p Upon accepting your position, your saved credit card will be charged $15 for you Volunteer T-shirt.  If you accept your position and do not make your shift, you will be liable for the full cost of a ticket plus a penalty fee totalling $360.
          %p You'll need to attend a volunteer meeting (which will most likely be held in Melbourne on 29 October). If you are a Ranger and cannot make the pre-festival training session, you will need to complete an onsite training session before you can complete your shifts.

          %p Much Love,
          %p Strawberry Fields
