## Pseudocode // Not even

# => A job may have skill requirements
  # => Could be RSA, Medical Training
  # => There should be a tag / note on the job if so, and a message with a tickbox (yes, I have the required skills)
    # => Should be an upload for documents to prove the skill requirement is met
# => :admin should be able to match up required skills with volunteers who have those skills


## As relates to a volunteer:
# => they should be able to add skills to their profile by checking a box, and uploading a relevant document
