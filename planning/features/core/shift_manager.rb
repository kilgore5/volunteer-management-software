### Pseudocode for feature planning

# => A shift manager is an employee of the Event
# => Should be able to view the volunteers they are assigned and their respective shifts.
# => Perhaps they are given a random color, and shifts are color coded in the Event view to match the manager
# => They are responsible for reporting a shift as attended or missed
# => They should also rate and hopefully comment on each shifts
# => Their payment is outside of this app
# =>
