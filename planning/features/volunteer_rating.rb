### Pseudocode for feature planning

## User ratings

  # - Each shift should be given a rating

  #   - volunteer is attached to rating

  #   - automatic zero if they don't show and it's their fault.

  #   - each rating should have a rater (shift manager)

  #   - each rating should have a comment

  #   - clicking a user's rating should take me to all of their shift reviews
